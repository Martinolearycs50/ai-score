# Recommendation Clarity Test Results

## Summary

The clarity tests revealed that while the recommendations are generally
well-structured with good examples, many need improvements in three key areas:

1. **Technical term explanations** (9 recommendations failed)
2. **Readability level** (15 recommendations too complex)
3. **Action-oriented language** (4 recommendations not actionable enough)

## Key Findings

### 1. Unexplained Technical Terms

The following terms need inline explanations:

- **CDN** → "CDN (Content Delivery Network - servers that cache your content
  globally)"
- **lazy-load** → "lazy-load (load content only when needed)"
- **anchor text** → "anchor text (the clickable words in a link)"
- **H1/H2/H3** → "H2 (section headings) and H3 (subsection headings)"
- **Schema markup** → "Schema markup (structured data tags that describe your
  content)"
- **NAP** → "NAP (Name, Address, Phone)"
- **meta tag** → "meta tag (HTML metadata in the page head)"
- **HTTP header** → "HTTP header (server response information)"
- **canonical** → "canonical URL (the preferred version of your page)"

### 2. Readability Issues

15 recommendations scored at College or Graduate reading level. They need
simpler sentence structures while maintaining sophistication.

**Current problem**: Too many complex sentences with multiple clauses
**Solution**: Break into shorter, clearer sentences with active voice

### 3. Missing Action Orientation

Some recommendations don't start with clear action verbs:

- authorBio
- deduplication
- napConsistency
- license

### 4. Recommendations Passing All Tests

These recommendations serve as good examples:

- paywall
- mainContent
- rssFeed
- headingDepth (mostly passing)

## Example Improvements Needed

### Before (ttfb):

```
fix: 'Use a CDN like Cloudflare (free tier available). Add caching headers: Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600. Consider static site generation for content pages.'
```

### After (improved):

```
fix: 'Speed up your server with a CDN (Content Delivery Network) like Cloudflare. Add caching to store pages: Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600. Generate static HTML files for faster loading.'
```

### Before (napConsistency):

```
fix: 'Add company name, address, and phone (NAP) to footer. Match exactly with Google Business listing.'
```

### After (improved):

```
fix: 'Display your NAP (Name, Address, Phone) consistently in the footer. Match this exactly with your Google Business profile to build trust.'
```

## Recommendations

1. **Add inline explanations** for all technical terms on first use
2. **Simplify sentence structure** while keeping professional tone
3. **Start with action verbs** in all fix instructions
4. **Maintain sophistication** through precise language and quantified benefits
5. **Keep examples concrete** and implementation-ready
