## Key Findings

### Where My Analysis Was Wrong:

1. **TTFB (10 pts difference)**: The page actually loads fast enough (<200ms).
   My assumption about multiple CSS/JS files was incorrect.

2. **Main Content Ratio (5 pts difference)**: The analyzer determined the main
   content is <70% of total text, while I estimated it at 70%.

3. **Deduplication (5 pts difference)**: The analyzer found duplicate content
   that I missed in manual review.

4. **Heading Depth (5 pts difference)**: The analyzer detected heading depth >3
   levels, which I didn't catch.

5. **Structured Data (5 pts difference)**: Despite seeing JSON-LD, it doesn't
   have the specific FAQ/HowTo/Dataset schema the analyzer requires.

### Where My Analysis Was Correct:

1. **All TRUST checks** - Perfect prediction
2. **All RECENCY checks** - Perfect prediction
3. **FACT DENSITY** - 3 out of 4 checks correct
4. **Citations and License** - Correctly identified missing external sources
