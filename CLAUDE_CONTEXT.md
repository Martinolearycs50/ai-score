### Scoring System (100 points total)
```
1. RETRIEVAL (30 pts)
   - Page speed, robots.txt, sitemaps, paywall detection
   
2. FACT_DENSITY (25 pts)
   - Statistics, entities, citations, data quality
   
3. STRUCTURE (20 pts)
   - Headings, semantic HTML, structured data
   
4. TRUST (15 pts)
   - Author info, dates, credibility signals
   
5. RECENCY (10 pts)
   - Last modified, content freshness
```

### API Contract
```typescript
// POST /api/analyze
Request: { url: string }
Response: {
  success: boolean
  data?: {
    aiSearchScore: number
    scoringResult: {
      pillars: PillarResults
      recommendations: Recommendation[]
    }
    websiteProfile?: WebsiteProfile
    extractedContent?: ExtractedContent
  }
  error?: string
}
```

## 📋 Current State (v2.5.0 - MVP Complete)

### MVP Features Completed
- ✅ 5-Pillar AI Scoring System (RETRIEVAL, FACT_DENSITY, STRUCTURE, TRUST, RECENCY)
- ✅ Dynamic content-aware recommendations
- ✅ Page type detection (8 types supported)
- ✅ Website comparison mode
- ✅ Emotional UI with animations
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Full test coverage
- ✅ Production deployment on Vercel

### Known Limitations
| Issue | Impact | Workaround |
|-------|--------|------------|
| CORS errors | Some sites block analysis | Server-side fetching |
| No persistence | Results lost on refresh | MVP scope limitation |
| Rate limit | 10 req/hour per IP | In-memory only |
| Single page | Analyzes one page at a time | By design for accuracy |

## 🔧 Code Standards (Stable Patterns)

### TypeScript
```typescript
// Always use strict types
interface Props {
  value: string;  // Required
  optional?: number;  // Optional
}

// Explicit return types
function calculate(x: number): number {
  return x * 2;
}
```

### Error Handling
```typescript
try {
  // Attempt operation
} catch (error) {
  // User-friendly message
  return { 
    success: false, 
    error: "Human readable explanation" 
  };
}
```

### Git Commits
```
feat: Add new feature
fix: Fix bug
docs: Update documentation
style: Format code
refactor: Restructure code
```

### Starting a Session
```
"Read CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md first.
Check recent commits for latest changes.
Then let's work on [task]"
```

### When Adding Features
1. Follow existing patterns
2. Keep changes small
3. Test thoroughly
4. Update "Recent Changes" if significant
5. Update "Active TODOs" if relevant

### Important Reminders
- Design is clean/white (NOT dark)
- All development through Claude Code
- Push to main = production deploy
- Keep user language non-technical

## 🔍 Quick Exploration Commands

```bash
# See what changed recently
git log --oneline -10

# Find existing patterns
grep -r "pattern" .

# Check current dependencies
cat package.json

# Run dev server
npm run dev
```

**Maintenance**: Claude Code should update the "Current State Tracking" section when making significant changes. Stable architecture sections rarely need updates.

🔒 Security Requirements

Critical Security Rules

Never expose API keys or secrets in frontend code
Validate all URLs before fetching (prevent SSRF attacks)
Sanitize error messages shown to users (no stack traces)
Rate limit all API endpoints (currently 10 req/hour)
Never trust user input - always validate and sanitize
Use HTTPS only for external requests

Current Security Measures

✅ URL validation before analysis
✅ Rate limiting on /api/analyze
✅ No database = no SQL injection risk
✅ No user accounts = no auth vulnerabilities
✅ TypeScript = type safety

Security Checklist for New Features

 Input validation on all user data
 Error messages don't leak system info
 No sensitive data in client-side code
 Dependencies are up-to-date
 CORS configured properly
 XSS prevention (React handles most)

Specific Vulnerabilities to Avoid
SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)
typescript// BAD - allows internal network scanning
const response = await fetch(userProvidedUrl);

// GOOD - validate URL first
function isValidUrl(url: string): boolean {
  try {
    const parsed = new URL(url);
    // Only allow http/https
    if (!['http:', 'https:'].includes(parsed.protocol)) return false;
    // Block localhost, private IPs, etc
    if (isPrivateIP(parsed.hostname)) return false;
    return true;
  } catch {
    return false;
  }
}
Information Disclosure
typescript// BAD - exposes internal errors
catch (error) {
  return { error: error.stack };  // Never do this!
}

// GOOD - generic user message
catch (error) {
  console.error(error);  // Log for debugging
  return { error: "Unable to analyze this website" };
}

For New Features

Keep dependencies updated

Key Patterns
typescript// URL validation

// Error handling
catch (error) {
  console.error(error);  // Log privately
  return { error: "Unable to analyze" };  // Generic message
}
