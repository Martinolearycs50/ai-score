## üìä Current Product State

### What We're Building: Free Tier
Automated webpage analysis that scores AI visibility across 5 pillars, with intelligent page type detection and actionable recommendations.

1. **RETRIEVAL** - Speed & Access (page performance, robots.txt, sitemaps)
2. **FACT_DENSITY** - Information Richness (statistics, entities, citations)
3. **STRUCTURE** - Content Organization (headings, schema, FAQ sections)
4. **TRUST** - Credibility Signals (HTTPS, author info, dates)
5. **RECENCY** - Content Freshness (updates, current references)

### Dynamic Scoring by Page Type
- **Homepage**: Prioritizes RETRIEVAL (35%) and STRUCTURE (25%)
- **Blog/Article**: Prioritizes FACT_DENSITY (35%) and RETRIEVAL (25%)
- **Product**: Balanced between FACT_DENSITY (30%) and RETRIEVAL/STRUCTURE (25% each)
