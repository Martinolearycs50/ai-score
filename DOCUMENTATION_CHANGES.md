# Documentation Restructure Summary

> Date: 2025-07-23

## What Changed

### Before: 26 scattered documentation files

- Multiple overlapping guides
- Difficult to find information
- Redundant content in many places
- Included unnecessary collaboration docs

### After: 8 focused documentation files

- Clear, purposeful structure
- No redundancy
- Optimized for solo founder with AI assistants
- Easy to navigate and maintain

## New Structure

### Root Directory (4 files)

1. **README.md** - Public-facing project overview
2. **PROJECT_VISION.md** - Product vision and roadmap (renamed from
   CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md)
3. **CLAUDE.md** - AI assistant instructions
4. **CHANGELOG.md** - Version history

### docs/ Directory (4 files)

1. **docs/README.md** - Documentation index and navigation
2. **docs/ARCHITECTURE.md** - System design and technical decisions
3. **docs/DEVELOPMENT.md** - Setup, debugging, testing, common issues
4. **docs/GLOBAL_STYLE_SYSTEM.md** - Design tokens and UI patterns

## Key Improvements

1. **Consolidated Technical Docs**
   - Merged 6 files → ARCHITECTURE.md
   - Merged 7 files → DEVELOPMENT.md
   - Clear separation of concerns

2. **Removed Unnecessary Files**
   - Deleted CONTRIBUTING.md (not needed for solo project)
   - Archived old test reports and redundant guides

3. **Better Navigation**
   - docs/README.md provides quick links
   - Each file has a clear, specific purpose
   - No more searching through multiple files

4. **AI-Friendly**
   - CLAUDE.md remains the single source for AI instructions
   - Updated to reference new structure
   - PROJECT_VISION.md tracks what needs building

## Archived Files

All old documentation moved to `docs/archive/old-docs/` with a deprecation
notice. This preserves history while keeping the active docs clean.

## Next Steps

1. Update any remaining references to old documentation
2. Add new content to the appropriate consolidated files
3. Keep documentation updated as features are built

This new structure makes the project more maintainable and professional while
being practical for a solo founder workflow.
